    Stepper Controller for stepper motor drivers
    This binding is used to configure the stepper controller in Zephyr.
    It is used to control the stepper motor driver.

    Example:
    stepper_control: stepper_control {
        compatible = "zephyr,stepper-control";
        stepper = <&gpio_stepper>;
        step-tick-ns = <1000000>;
    };

compatible: "zephyr,stepper-control"

properties:
  step-tick-ns:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The time in nanoseconds between each step signal.

  counter:
    type: phandle
    description: Counter used for generating step-accurate pulse signals.
