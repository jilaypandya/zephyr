    Stepper Controller for stepper motor drivers
    This binding is used to configure the stepper controller in Zephyr.
    It is used to control the stepper motor driver.
    
    Example:
    stepper_controller: stepper_controller {
        compatible = "zephyr,stepper-controller";
        stepper = <&stepper1>;
        step-tick-ns = <1000>;
    };

compatible: "zephyr,stepper-control"

properties:
    stepper:
        type: phandle
        required: true
        description: |
          The phandle to the stepper motor driver node.

    step-tick-ns:
        type: int
        required: true
        description: |
          The time in nanoseconds between each step signal.
