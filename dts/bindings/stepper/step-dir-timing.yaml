description: Step/Dir Control Signal Timing

properties:
  high-level-width-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      Pulse width in nanoseconds for the step signal.
      This is the minimum duration for which the step signal is asserted high.

  low-level-width-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      Low level width in nanoseconds for the step signal.
      This is the minimum duration for which the step signal is asserted low.

  step-period-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      Total period in nanoseconds for the step signal.

  dir-to-step-setup-time-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      Setup time in nanoseconds from the direction signal change to the step signal.
      This is the minimum time that the direction signal must be stable before the step signal is asserted.

  dir-after-step-hold-time-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      Hold time in nanoseconds after the step signal for the direction signal.
      This is the minimum time that the direction signal must remain stable after the step signal is deasserted.
