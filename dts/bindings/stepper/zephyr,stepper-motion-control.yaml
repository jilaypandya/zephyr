  CPU based Stepper Motion Controller for stepper motor drivers
  This binding is used to configure the stepper controller in Zephyr.
  It is used to control the stepper motor driver.
  Example:
  stepper_motion_control: stepper_motion_control {
      compatible = "zephyr,stepper-motion-control";
      stepper = <&gpio_stepper>;
  };

compatible: "zephyr,stepper-motion-control"

properties:
  counter:
    type: phandle
    description: Counter used for generating step-accurate pulse signals.

  stepper:
    type: phandle
    required: true

      The stepper motor driver to be controlled by the stepper motion controller.
      This should be a reference to a stepper motor driver node in the device tree.
